Build for Linux
If you prefer to compile your own binary files, then you need the developer packages:

Ubuntu / Debian:
 sudo apt-get install git qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev
   libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev
   libssl-dev libdb ++ - dev libqrencode-dev

If you have an error installing qt4-qmake (Arises on Ubuntu 14.04.2 and possibly in other versions)
libcheese-gtk23: Depends: libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 (> = 0.91.8) but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: libcogl15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
libcheese7: Depends: libclutter-gst-2.0-0 (> = 0.10.0) but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: gstreamer1.0-clutter but it is not going to be installed
libclutter-1.0-0: Depends: libcogl-pango15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libcogl15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed

Then enter
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0 xserver-xorg-input-all

openSUSE (verified on version 13.2):
 sudo zypper install git gcc-c ++ libqt4-devel boost-devel libopenssl-devel libdb-4_8-devel libqrencode3

After the installation was completed, you can clone the Ammo repository:
	git clone https://github.com/AmmoCore/ammoreloaded.git

and finally, compile your client:

Note: for all of the 'make' commands below, it is recommended to speed things up by using the '-j' option followed by the number of cores on your processor. This enables multi-threading. Example:
make -j4 #4 core processor, utilizes the whole processor and takes much less time to compile

cd ammoreloaded/src/leveldb/
make clean
make
make libmemenv.a 

#to compile the coin daemon:
cd ..
make -f makefile.unix

#to compile the graphical version:
cd ammoreloaded
qmake
make

#after compiling both clients, don't forget to strip them, reducing their size by around 90%:
strip Ammod
strip Ammo-qt

#If you want to build using static libraries:
make -f makefile.unix STATIC=1
qmake RELEASE=1

And that should be it. If you have any problems compiling please create an issue so it can be fixed ASAP!
